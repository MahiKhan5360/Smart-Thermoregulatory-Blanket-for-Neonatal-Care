# System Specification Development Proposal: Smart Thermoregulatory Blanket for Neonatal Care

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose

This proposal outlines the development of a smart thermoregulatory blanket to maintain optimal body temperature (36.5–37.5°C) for premature infants, particularly in low-resource settings where incubators may be unavailable. The system monitors infant skin temperature, adjusts heating elements to maintain a safe range, and alerts caregivers via a display or mobile app if temperature deviates. This project is ideal for an embedded system course, as it requires designing a safety-critical, closed-loop control system with constrained hardware resources, low-power operation, and reliable sensor integration, challenging students to optimize performance and ensure infant safety.

### Scope

The system will include:

- A soft blanket embedded with temperature sensors and heating elements.
- A microcontroller for real-time temperature control and monitoring.
- A display for local alerts and status.
- A Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module for caregiver notifications.
- A mobile application for remote monitoring and configuration. The project focuses on a functional prototype. Cloud integration, medical-grade certification (e.g., FDA), and advanced analytics are outside the scope.
